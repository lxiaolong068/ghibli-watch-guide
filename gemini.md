Streaming into Ghibli's Worlds: Exploring Online Platforms in the USA
For many, the first thought when seeking out a movie is to turn to the vast libraries of online streaming services. When it comes to Studio Ghibli, the landscape of digital availability in the United States is quite defined.
Max, formerly known as HBO Max, has become the exclusive streaming home for the majority of the Studio Ghibli library in North America . This means that subscribers to Max in the United States have access to a wide selection of these beloved films.
While Netflix boasts a considerable collection of Studio Ghibli films in many regions, its availability explicitly excludes the United States, Canada, and Japan . Therefore, Netflix is not a primary platform for streaming Studio Ghibli movies in the US, with the exception of "Grave of the Fireflies" .
Apple TV+ also offers Studio Ghibli films in various regions, including "Asia Pacific" . However, in the United States, the primary streaming home remains Max . It is possible to rent or purchase Ghibli films on Apple TV.1
Amazon Prime Video offers many Studio Ghibli titles for rent or purchase . Additionally, in the US, access to Max is possible through Amazon Prime Video channels.6 This provides another avenue for US viewers to access the extensive Ghibli library available on Max.
RetroCrush, a streaming service focused on classic anime, acquired the rights to stream Hayao Miyazaki's pre-Ghibli work, "Future Boy Conan," in North America . While this is exciting for fans of Miyazaki's early work, it does not include the main Studio Ghibli film library, which is primarily on Max in the US.
In summary, the digital streaming landscape for Studio Ghibli in the United States is primarily dominated by Max, with options for rental or purchase available on platforms like Apple TV and Amazon Prime Video.
