# Ghibli Watch Guide Project Rules

## 1. Project Overview

- **Goal:** Create an informational website detailing where to legally watch Studio Ghibli films across different regions (North America, Europe, Japan, etc.).
- **Primary Language:** English (Website content), although internal documentation might be in Chinese.
- **Target Users:** Ghibli fans, users looking for specific film availability, potential streaming service subscribers.

## 2. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Starwind UI
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via Starwind UI)
- **Database:** Neon (Serverless Postgres)
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Package Manager:** `pnpm` (Strictly use `pnpm` for all package operations)
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Testing:** Vitest

## 3. Key Directories

- `app/`: Contains Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
- `lib/`: Utility functions, API clients (e.g., `lib/tmdb.ts`), database access logic.
- `prisma/`: Database schema (`schema.prisma`) and migration files.
- `docs/`: Project documentation (requirements, development plan).
- `src/`: Potentially shared components or types (current usage might vary).
- `scripts/`: Scripts for tasks like database seeding.

## 4. Data Handling

- **Movie Information:** Primarily sourced from the TMDB API (using `lib/tmdb.ts` and `/api/movies/[id]`). API Key is in `.env`.
- **Viewing Availability Data:**
    - This data (regional streaming/rental/purchase options) was initially planned to be stored in the database (`Availability` table via Prisma) and supplemented by web scraping or specific APIs.
    - **Current Status:** This feature and the corresponding database tables/logic (`Availability`, `Region`, `Platform`) are **currently paused/removed** as per `development.md`. Focus is on displaying movie details from TMDB.
    - Future implementation will require careful data sourcing and a mechanism for regular updates (`lastChecked` field was planned).
- **Database:** Neon DB accessed via Prisma. Connection details are in `.env`.

## 5. Development Practices

- **Package Management:** Always use `pnpm install`, `pnpm add`, `pnpm remove`, etc.
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests using Vitest. Run tests after implementing new features or significant modifications. Check `vitest.config.ts` and `vitest.setup.ts`.
- **Data Accuracy:** Maintaining accurate viewing availability information is crucial (when the feature is re-implemented). Include "last updated" timestamps.
- **SEO:** Leverage Next.js features (Server Components, Metadata API) for search engine optimization.
- **Code Style:** Follow standard TypeScript/React best practices and formatting (ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.json`, Prettier likely integrated).
- **State Management:** Utilize Next.js Server Components, Client Components, and React hooks/Context as appropriate. Keep client-side state minimal where possible.

## 6. Deployment

- Automated deployments to Vercel are configured via `vercel.json` and Git integration.
- Ensure all necessary environment variables (`.env`) are set in Vercel project settings.
