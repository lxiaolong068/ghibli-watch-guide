# Studio Ghibli Movie Availability in the USA and Europe

Studio Ghibli films are now widely accessible via streaming, but availability differs by region due to licensing deals ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)). Below is a breakdown for the United States and for Europe, listing which platforms offer Ghibli movies and under what terms (subscription vs. rental/purchase), along with any notable regional differences or changes.

## United States (USA)

- **Max (subscription)** – In the U.S., **Max** (formerly HBO Max) is the exclusive subscription streaming home for Studio Ghibli’s film library ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)). Nearly the entire Ghibli catalog is included with a Max subscription – from classics like *My Neighbor Totoro* and *Spirited Away* to lesser-known titles – all available on-demand. One notable exception is **_Grave of the Fireflies_ (1988)**, which is **not** on Max (its distribution rights were held separately) ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)). Aside from that outlier, Max offers the full collection of Ghibli animated features as part of its monthly plan in the US.

- **Netflix (subscription)** – Generally, Netflix **does not carry** Studio Ghibli films in the US due to the exclusive deal with HBO/Max ([Every Studio Ghibli Movie on Netflix & How To Watch In Order](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/what-to-watch/every-studio-ghibli-movie-on-netflix/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Studio%20Ghibli%20movies,library%20is%20exclusive%20to%20Max)). An exception emerged in late 2024: Netflix U.S. added *Grave of the Fireflies* to its catalog ([Every Studio Ghibli Movie on Netflix & How To Watch In Order](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/what-to-watch/every-studio-ghibli-movie-on-netflix/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Studio%20Ghibli%20movies,library%20is%20exclusive%20to%20Max)). Apart from that single title, no other Ghibli movies are available on Netflix in America (Netflix’s Ghibli streaming rights cover other regions, not North America). This means U.S. viewers will **not** find titles like *Totoro* or *Princess Mononoke* on Netflix – those are instead on Max.

- **Digital purchase or rental (Amazon, Apple, etc.)** – All Studio Ghibli films can be accessed in the U.S. by renting or buying them digitally on major platforms. This includes services like **Amazon Prime Video** (digital store), **Apple TV/iTunes**, **Google Play Movies/YouTube**, **Vudu**, and others ([Studio Ghibli movies are finally available to purchase digitally — but missing a major title | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026683/studio-ghibli-movies-digital-purchase-streaming-hbo-max-grave-of-fireflies#:~:text=Nearly%20the%20entire%20collection%20of,purchase%20digitally%20anywhere%20in%20the)). Nearly the entire collection became available for digital purchase for the first time in late 2019, and each film can be bought or rented individually in HD (with both English and Japanese audio options) ([Studio Ghibli movies are finally available to purchase digitally — but missing a major title | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026683/studio-ghibli-movies-digital-purchase-streaming-hbo-max-grave-of-fireflies#:~:text=Nearly%20the%20entire%20collection%20of,This%20is%20the%20first)). For example, if you don’t have a Max subscription, you can rent or purchase *Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind* or *Kiki’s Delivery Service* on Amazon Prime Video or YouTube as standalone titles ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=,IGN%27s%20Review)). These digital VOD options are pay-per-title (not included in any subscription), but they ensure that U.S. viewers can watch any Ghibli movie on-demand by renting or owning it. 

## Europe (Including UK & Other Territories)

- **Netflix (subscription)** – In Europe, **Netflix** is the primary streaming platform for Studio Ghibli’s catalogue. Starting in early 2020, Netflix secured rights to stream Ghibli films across virtually all European markets (and globally outside of North America and Japan) ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)). This means that the vast majority of Ghibli’s animated films are included **with a Netflix subscription** throughout Europe. Initially 21 films were released on Netflix, and by 2024 this grew to 23 titles after adding newer entries like *Earwig and the Witch* (2020) and the previously missing *Grave of the Fireflies* ([Every Studio Ghibli Movie on Netflix & How To Watch In Order](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/what-to-watch/every-studio-ghibli-movie-on-netflix/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20all%2021%20Studio,start%20with%20the%20new%20additions)). European Netflix subscribers can therefore stream almost the **full Ghibli collection** – from famous works such as *Howl’s Moving Castle* and *Ponyo* to every other classic feature – at no extra cost beyond the standard Netflix fee. *(Notably, HBO Max does **not** have these films in Europe; the Netflix deal gives Netflix exclusive streaming rights to Ghibli content in those territories ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)).)* In late 2024, even Hayao Miyazaki’s newest film *The Boy and the Heron* was slated to hit Netflix internationally (outside the US) as part of this arrangement ([Every Studio Ghibli Movie on Netflix & How To Watch In Order](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/what-to-watch/every-studio-ghibli-movie-on-netflix/#:~:text=In%202020%2C%20all%2021%20Studio,start%20with%20the%20new%20additions)), further ensuring European audiences get new Ghibli releases via Netflix.

- **Digital purchase or rental (Amazon, Apple, etc.)** – European viewers also have the option to **rent or buy** Studio Ghibli movies through digital storefronts. Platforms such as **Amazon Prime Video** (Amazon’s video store in European countries), **Apple TV/iTunes**, **Google Play/YouTube Movies**, and other local VOD services offer the Ghibli films for individual purchase or 48-hour rental. This means if one does not have Netflix, they can still watch Ghibli titles by renting or buying them on these services (for example, UK users can purchase classics like *Spirited Away* or new titles like *The Boy and the Heron* on Amazon, iTunes, or the Microsoft Store) ([Studio Ghibli movies are finally available to purchase digitally — but missing a major title | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026683/studio-ghibli-movies-digital-purchase-streaming-hbo-max-grave-of-fireflies#:~:text=Nearly%20the%20entire%20collection%20of,purchase%20digitally%20anywhere%20in%20the)) ([How to watch Studio Ghibli's The Boy and the Heron at home](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a44511892/how-do-you-live-ghibli-uk-release-date/#:~:text=home%20www,available%20to%20watch%20on)). All major Studio Ghibli films are available in these digital catalogs across Europe, usually in multiple languages, since the global push to release Ghibli’s library on digital platforms extended beyond North America for the first time around 2019–2020 ([Studio Ghibli movies are finally available to purchase digitally — but missing a major title | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026683/studio-ghibli-movies-digital-purchase-streaming-hbo-max-grave-of-fireflies#:~:text=Nearly%20the%20entire%20collection%20of,purchase%20digitally%20anywhere%20in%20the)). As in the US, these are pay-per-title offerings (not part of a subscription); for instance, a fan in Europe could rent *Princess Mononoke* or *Porco Rosso* on Amazon’s UK store, or buy a permanent digital copy via Apple’s store. This provides an alternative way to access any specific Ghibli movie on-demand outside of the Netflix subscription.

**Regional Notes & Recent Changes:** The split between HBO/Max and Netflix came about in 2020, marking the first time Studio Ghibli films were available to stream anywhere ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)). Prior to that, Ghibli famously resisted streaming releases. The **USA vs. Europe availability** is a deliberate licensing difference: WarnerMedia’s deal made **Max the exclusive streaming home in North America**, while **Netflix serves as the streaming home internationally** ([Where to Watch Every Studio Ghibli Movie Online in 2025](https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-studio-ghibli-movies#:~:text=Max%20is%20the%20streaming%20home,but%20before%20the%20studio%27s%20founding)). One **limitation** had been the film *Grave of the Fireflies*, which for years was absent from all streaming deals because its rights were held by a different company (Shinchosha) rather than Ghibli’s distribution partners ([Studio Ghibli movies are finally available to purchase digitally — but missing a major title | The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026683/studio-ghibli-movies-digital-purchase-streaming-hbo-max-grave-of-fireflies#:~:text=One%20movie%20is%20noticeably%20absent,during%20the%20second%20World%20War)). This changed in 2024 when *Grave of the Fireflies* finally became available to stream on Netflix (worldwide, including the US) ([Every Studio Ghibli Movie on Netflix & How To Watch In Order](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/what-to-watch/every-studio-ghibli-movie-on-netflix/#:~:text=Please%20note%3A%20Studio%20Ghibli%20movies,library%20is%20exclusive%20to%20Max)). Aside from that special case, virtually **all other Studio Ghibli movies** can now be found on the platforms listed above in their respective regions, either included with a subscription (Max or Netflix) or via on-demand digital rental/purchase. This comprehensive availability is a recent development, making it easier than ever for fans in both the USA and Europe to enjoy Studio Ghibli’s full collection of animated masterpieces.
